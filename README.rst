Python Control for PlayStation 4 consoles.
============================

|BuildStatus| |PypiVersion| |PyPiPythonVersions|

Purpose
----------
To add a pure python implementation of ps4-waker. Including PS4 credential creation.
Integration with Home-Assistant. 

Compatibility
----------
Tested on:
Python 3.5/3.6/3.7
Home-Assistant/Hass.IO 0.89


**This package can be used as a standalone api. It does not require the use of Home Assistant.

Installation
----------
run "pip install pyps4-homeassistant"

Ports
----------
PS4 listens on ports 987 and 997 (Priveleged).
Must run command on python path if no access:

"sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /usr/bin/python3.5"

Usage
----------
API should be accessed initially like the following examples.

Most functions can be accessed from the high-level PS4 object.


import pyps4_homeassistant

pyps4_homeassistant.ps4.Ps4("192.168.0.2", "YourCredentials")


Credentials can be generated by running:

creds = pyps4_homeassistant.credential.Credentials()
credentials = creds.start()

This will start the credential service and will return the credentials for the PSN Account. You will need to get the PS4 Second Screen app for Android or iOS to do this. Once you have logged in with your acccount in the app and started the service, refresh the devices in the app and select the device name 'Home-Assistant'. 



Cover Art Issues
----------
If you find that media art cannot be found. Please post an issue with your Region, Country, Title of game, an ID of game.

To Do List:
----------
- Port TCP and UDP functions to Asyncio.
